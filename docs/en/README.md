# AgentX Documentation

AgentX is an AI workbench for data analysis. It brings natural-language questions, data source management, read-only SQL execution, analysis traceability, and result delivery into a single workflow—so you can move through exploratory data analysis faster.

These docs are for product trials, customer demos, open-source visitors, and integration developers. Public documentation is available in English and Chinese.

## Recommended path

For a first trial, read in this order:

1. Read [Product overview](overview.md) to confirm the problem space and capability boundaries.
2. Follow [Quick start](quick-start.md) to configure a model API key and run your first question against the built-in DTC Growth Review data source.
3. Read [Capabilities](capabilities.md) to see coverage across Web, TUI, and backend API.
4. Choose [Web workbench guide](guides/web-workbench.md) or [TUI guide](guides/tui.md) based on your entry point.
5. When you need your own data, read [Data sources guide](guides/data-sources.md).

## Documentation scope

This directory focuses on the public reading experience. It does not include project management notes, implementation plans, AI collaboration logs, historical refactor logs, or source-sensitive early discussions. Public docs describe only capabilities confirmed by current code, configuration, scripts, and local README files.

If you are extending or integrating the product, start with `reference/` and `architecture/`. If you are just trying the product, `overview.md`, `quick-start.md`, `capabilities.md`, and `guides/` cover the main paths.
